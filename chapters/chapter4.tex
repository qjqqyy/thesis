\chapter{Solovay Model}

The Solovay model is an interesting model in which choice fails.
It might be of particular interests to analysts due to its many interesting analytical and measure-theoretic properties.

\section{Lévy Collapse}


\newcommand*{\Lv}{\operatorname{Lv}}
\begin{definition}
    For any \(S\subseteq \mathbf{ORD}\) and \(\lambda\) regular, the \emph{Lévy collapsing order} for \(S\) is
    \[
        \Lv(\lambda, S) = \set{p: p\text{ is a function} \land \abs{p} < \lambda \land \dom(p) \subseteq S\times\lambda
        \land \forall (\alpha,n)\in\dom(p)\sq{p(\alpha,n)\in \alpha}}
    \]
    ordered by reverse inclusion.
\end{definition}

Cue various properties of Lévy collapse.

* Collapsing kappa to omega1

* Preserving all cardinals above

* Being able to collapse in stages
